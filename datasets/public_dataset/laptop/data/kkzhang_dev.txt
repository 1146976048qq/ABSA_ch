One thing I did't like is the stylus holder, it's cheap plastic and doesn't seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the USB port.	0
I do't use it, I think I would accidently break it and loose my stylus.	0
The other Issue I had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it.	0
Awesome laptop for college!!!	2
Can be used for gaming as well.	2
It's light, fast and has great battery!!	2
It's a steal when considering the specs and performance as well.	2
The processor and GPU are fantastic at running games and multiple apps.	2
I can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed.	2
The backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially.	2
Make sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast.	0
I'm overall very pleased with my new laptop!!!	2
The only downside are the speakers.	0
They don't go very loud at all.	0
The quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me.	2
This is mostly not an issue since I mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times.	0
The screen looked fine to me and wasn't an issue like others have been saying.	2
Overall great for me!!!	2
This laptop has delivered.	2
I immediately did the Windows 10 upgrade and haven't had any issues.	2
The wireless adapter is strong and the SSD is fast.	2
This thing boots in just a few seconds which is nice.	2
Others have mentioned issues with viewing angle on the screen, but I never use the laptop where I'm not looking straight at it so it doesn't bother me.	1
I'm very pleased with the purchase.	2
Boot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute.	2
Apps launch super fast, and the 500GB HDD is more than sufficient.	2
I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing, so the entry-level 13' MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for.	2
Macs hardly ever get viruses, and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses.	2
Furthermore, Mac OS X Mountain Lion's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans, which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed.	2
The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit, which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing (Typing?).	2
Overall, the screen resolution, though non-retina, is sufficient for normal web browsing and work.	2
The thunderbolt port is awesome!	2
US 3.0 comes with the MBP and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps.	1
Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack.	1
SDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs.	1
The glass track pad is large enough for Apple's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers, zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers, accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers.	2
For Windows users switching to a Mac, you can also enable right clicking (known to apple as secondary click) in the system preferences&gt; Mouse and enabling right clicking.	2
The unique to apple aluminium uni-body is a real beauty.	2
It makes the MBP very durable and protects it from scratches, though you shouldn't go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it.	2
The Mac app store and iTunes store are phenomenal.	2
The Mac app store is your one-stop shop for Mac software, though you can also download software online at your own risk.	2
There are currently around 10,000 apps on the App store (and counting...), and billions of songs available for download fro the iTunes store.	2
iTunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it's simple to use User Interface.	2
I'm sure you won't regret making this purchase.	2
One of the worst pieces of electronics I have ever bought.	0
Very pour performance.	0
It takes for ever to wake it up.	0
Sometimes It stops receiving wifi signal, so I have to restart it.	0
It is very slow and not responsive.	0
Would not recommend.	0
Glare is also pretty frustrating.	0
There is definitely more to say...	0
I tested it, it worked great.	2
He received it, and one day later it DIES.	0
The laptop refuses to start, we have troubleshooted all areas, still fails to start.	0
Cannot even get to bios.	0
Just a click and a BLACK SCREEN.	0
Of course, it DIES 3 days past the return window.	0
We got two days of operation from this laptop.	0
When the MacBook Pro arrived, I helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the PC to the Mac... an easy drag-and-drop process utilizing a flash drive.	2
It was delivered with 4GB of RAM -- 2GB on each of two sticks -- which was probably adequate.	2
So I simply pulled one 2GB stick from the machine and installed the 8GB stick in its place.	2
The machine now has 10 gigs of RAM and it works just fine.	2
But, hey, it's an Apple.	2
I wouldn't expect anything less!	2
If it was possible to give them 0 start, I would have done it.	0
My Laptop's one of the Key from keyboard came out and it was mechanical failure.	0
My laptop was under coverage but when I gave it to them for repairs, they quoted me $755 for it.	0
this company just wants customers' money in their pocket.	0
they dont care how you feel when they charge you hundreds of hard earned dollars.	0
I wish this company to go bust.	0
I will never ever buy any apple product in my life.	0
Overall I love it.	2
First, when I move the screen to put it in tablet position, the hinge doesn't seem totally solid.	0
I feel like I need to be really gentle with it, but maybe that's just me.	1
Also, and this maybe is another personal quirk, but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop.	0
First off, AMAZING LAPTOP!	2
Three years ago I had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great!	2
If I were to have any technical difficulties, the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap, it was quite impressive.	2
I myself had purchased the 750 gig drive laptop and as a DJ with thousands of songs, pictures, and other things...and after 3 years I have managed to fill around 9% of my gigs.	2
There is SO MUCH ROOM!	2
Pros  1. Amazing storage (both 500gig and 750gig)	2
2. 8 gig ram needed if you are as productive as I am (DJ, photography, movie making, etc) its quick!	2
3. No anti spyware needed, never had a virus and I never will	2
4. build solid and durable	2
5. bought the 3 year warranty and boy it was needed (because of my doings)	2
Cons.  1. If you fall behind in updates, your laptop will become progressively slower, just update it...then its back to normal	1
2. Sometimes when I stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on, other times it is a few seconds	0
3. Cannot manually take battery out, unless you work for apple or have the tools	0
Overall, it is a fantastic laptop.	2
Mine has been though hundreds of parties, weddings, quinces, anything involving performances, it can take it!	2
This laptop was made for art, music, beat-making, pictures, movies, graphic design.	2
By the way, it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what I had just listed.	2
This laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade.	2
Soon I will be hitting the 5 year mark and I think this thing can make it another 5 in my opinion.	2
Get this now!!!	2
By the way...I paid for this particular laptop roughly 2 grand...LOOK AT THE PRICE NOW!	2
This is a great laptop.	2
I bought it for college and couldn't be happier.	2
The SSD and I7 complement each other really well.	2
I was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows 10, but it is pretty awesome.	2
If you are looking for a light, durable, and extremely effecient laptop, buy this one!	2
They really know what they are doing.	2
The laptop is so easy to work with.	2
Like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do, very user-friendly.	2
Its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great, aside from its quality design and sexy looks.	2
If you dont like windows I would suggest trying a Mac.	2
The investment is worth it.	2
Have bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever.	2
Mac User interface is just the best.	2
Also, the laptop is quite, no more burnt laps, best screen display, and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over.	2
Only thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality!	2
Not impressed with Macintosh products.	0
In fact I am completely frustrated.	0
Also, many software programs are not compatible with the IOS platform.	0
Be sure the programs you need will work on a MAC before you buy one!	0
I had heard people speak highly of the MacBook Pro for college students, and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use.	2
The MacBook Pro is useful for college students for many reasons:	2
It is the cheapest product in the line of MacBook's	2
The new operating system called Snow Leopard is installed and ready for use	2
The battery life has increased from the last version from 4 hours to 7 hours, making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger.	2
Reliability: Throughout the past few years, I have had no problems with the MacBook Pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws.	2
Durability: My computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it, but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it.	2
Usability: The MacBook Pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn't necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers.	2
The processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly.	2
The MacBook Pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes:	2
Pros:  o It usually runs very smoothly, but Apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers.	2
o It has an extended battery life.	2
o It is extremely user friendly.	2
Cons:  o Some people don't enjoy the way the processing system runs, but don't have any issues with getting it to function.	2
o Others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for, for example engineering majors need extra applications &amp; systems to do some work, but they are easily downloadable.	2
My first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also, brilliant.	2
So far so good.	2
Battery doesn't hold up to what it said in the description but I got it refurb'd and I imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price (Just a guess).	0
Still getting used to typing on it, my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where I was typing.	1
Plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop, I really don't have anything to compare it to.	2
Note: no DVD drive, no Ethernet port	0
Screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch  with a normal adult finger.	0
The brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light.	0
Keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best.	0
The touch pad feel is a 4 on scale  1 - 10.	0
Computer seemed sluggish for an Intel Core i5 device.	0
Power on - good luck finding it.	0
I would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy.	0
signed: not impressed	0
I bought this a few months ago and it's holding up fairly well.	2
Runs fast, the touch screen hasn't lost any sensitivity, I'm overall very happy with it.	2
This one doesn't do that.	0
The trackpad is pretty crappy - but aren't they all?	0
This is my first Apple computer and I couldn't be more pleased.	2
IOS does everything its billed to do and much, much more.	2
Literally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind.	2
I can't believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes.	2
The computer of the people!	2
I love this laptop.	2
The batter lasts as long as claimed.	2
I get about 5 or so hours playing the sims.	2
I haven't really officially tested it yet, but it's a long time.	2
I hate plugging my laptop in because I don't want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery, but with this laptop I rarely have to charge it.	2
The touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus.	2
The only problem I have is with windows 8.	0
I hate windows 8.	0
It made me sign up with Microsoft and sometimes won't let me download things that are harmful to my computer, but that's what anti virus software is for lol.	0
The wifi rumor hasn't happened to me.	2
The wifi works great.	2
It feels very well built.	2
The metal is very expensive feeling.	2
The laptop is a little more than an inch thick when closed.	1
I'm a very weak girl and I could lift this laptop with one hand, however I'd get tired soon lol.	0
The 15.6&amp;#34; screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands.	0
I bought my first MacBook exactly 5 months ago and was really happy with my new toy, but what was not my surprise when I turned it on 2 days ago and the screen was completely black.	0
I can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead.	0
The best computer I've ever bought.	2
The simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files.	2
The only issue I had was with the harddrive.	0
The harddrive crashed and I thought I had lost the whole computer.	0
Replacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy, a couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play.	2
And apple was happy to install the latest osx for free!	2
You wont be disappointed with this computer!	2
It's just a matter of getting used to the touch-pad commands.	1
Thankfully I have earphones and an external amplifier for audio; the onboard speakers are just terrible.	0
But what should I expect from a unit that is this thin and this light?	1
The most disappointing purchase of my life!	0
I received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after I purchased this horrible machine.	0
Within the first few months that I bought it, there was clearly a problem with the hard drive.	0
The online customer service was awful.	0
Gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile.	0
No one would ever answer my question as to why I couldn't get another new Macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my Macbook was still under warranty.	0
As a matter of fact, no matter how many times I asked that question, the employees I spoke purposely ignored it.	0
They didn't say yes and they didn't say no, they just pretended that I never asked it, which was incredibly frustrating.	0
I've been to the &amp;#34;genius&amp;#34; bar several times (they have been very nice).	2
They have now basically replaced everything inside my machine, told me there was a problem with the hardware, so I now have a &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; machine.	0
Maybe I'm not being reasonable, but I don't feel that's the same as a new computer because I didn't pay for a refurbished computer.	0
I still have weird freezing problems with it and it's pretty slow, but it's not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in.	0
I had delusions of grandeur regarding Apple's &amp;#34;great customer service&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;reliability of their machines&amp;#34; etc.. etc...blah...blah...	0
I'm sure most people's Macbooks work just fine, but FYI, if you get the factory dud, you're stuck with it and no one at Apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away.	0
One OS for this platform, no OEM OS paraphernalia and automatic updates.	2
I am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the MAC!	2
Well she was right, Whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works.	2
I'm no power user, but I have had no learning curve with the MAC and I don't do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the OS.	2
I did buy Office 2008 for the MAC at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for $64 and that was  a steal in my opinion.	2
Otherwise I am happily a  Mac user.	2
For a premium laptop sold in 2013, the Apple MacBook Pro (13 inch, base model) is about as basic as it gets: no SSD, no discrete graphics, no 1080p display, and no touch screen.	1
But Apple does not pretend it has any of these.	2
What it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side, Apple's OSX Mountain Lion, the sleek looks Apple always delivers, reasonable specs, good battery life, nice keyboard, and excellent trackpad.	2
Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs.	0
The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution.	2
This Mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair.	2
Hard drives can be replaced, RAM can be added as needed, and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge.	2
This, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer's value.	0
Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer.	0
TLDR version: good, reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive.	0
I am really sorry I bought this machine.	0
I was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase.	0
This machine has made me go there 5 times and has been nothing but a continuous problem.	0
Finally, they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement.	1
(It's a lemon).	0
So, I'm cooled on Mac buys.	0
They did not replace the motherboard.	0
Instead they 'tightened' a loose wire.	0
It also has a big new scratch on the top cover.	0
I started it up and it still has the same problem I went in to fix.	0
So I'm going back to Genius Bar for visit #6.	0
I think it may have to be 'Apple Don't Care' instead of Apple Care.	0
You get what you pay for, right?	0
Mac is complicated and frustrating at moments.	0
I watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough.	0
I should have known better.	0
I hope you don't make the same mistake...	0
When I first got the computer, I noticed the tracking pad was hard to click.	0
I took my Macbook to the Apple store and they had to replace the battery after 1 month of use since it was swelling.	0
They tried to tell me that the battery wasn't covered by the warranty and it costs about $150 to replace.	0
They ended up not charging me.	1
Other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long, I'm pretty happy with the computer.	0
I'm a designer turned front-end developer and this computer is unusable for front-end development.	0
Opening photoshop takes FOooooooRRREVER, as do all programs that do not begin with an 'i'.	0
The free upgrade to Mountain Lion FAILED.	0
It tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again.	0
Before and after I resolved that issue, I saw the damn 'beachball' all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it's doing while I wait for it.	0
I spend so much time waiting for it.	0
I can't believe people like these computers.	0
Now that they are not virus free ([...]l) I see absolutely no benefit to Apple products as they are slower, more expensive, and do not last as long.	0
Don't waste your money.	0
My HP seemed great at first, then the problems started.....wireless adapter would just &quot;disappear&quot; and the system said it didn't have a network card.	0
Sometimes it comes back, sometimes not.	0
HP was NO help.	0
The lettering wore off the keys, so you better be able to type blind.	0
The battery lasted 12 months, then pffft.....gone.	0
When I had a boot up issue, the HP recovery didn't work.	0
The disks I made wouldn't work.....HP support stated &quot;we're a hardware company, not a software company.&quot;	0
Then there was a power cord recall....HP never notified us.....and we did register......never again.	0
I don't have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support, search functions, or hold times.....dropped the HP and never looked back.	0
I gave this product 5 stars because I have been looking for a MacBook Pro for a long time and I found it here for a wonderful price.	2
I have used this product for only 2 days, but I can't wait to use it more.	2
I really like Mac/Apple products because of their operating system.	2
I can tweet and use Facebook from the sidebar which is really nice.	2
I also like I have the option to push calendars, photos, and contacts to an iPad, iPod Touch, or iPhone (if I had any of those).	2
The only thing I have had trouble with so far is transferring music to iTunes which I would have liked to do though &amp;#34;Home Sharing&amp;#34; (I used iTunes on a computer separate from my Linux computer) but I could not figure that out.	0
I just ended up using my iPod to transfer my iTunes music and I re-downloaded my Amazon music (losing my ratings).	0
I have not tried gaming on it but I have heard that Mac/Apple does not do games well.	0
I plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time.	2
When I decided to buy my first computer, I wish I had bought a Mac first.	2
If the price doesn't deter you, you'll find it well worth it in terms of trouble-free operation.	0
I've had it for more than a year, and I've found that no anti-virus software is needed, as long as you don't download anything without being 100% sure that it's from a legitimate source.	2
From time to time I get the 'spinning beach ball' that holds up progress.	0
I can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the 'Show all bookmarks' icon (the open book icon at the upper left).	2
Once in a long while that doesn't work; in that case I turn the computer off, then on again, and sign in -- problem solved.	1
I'll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself, and just conclude by saying that I'm delighted with my purchase.	2
Received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed.	2
To go left I have to go right and vice versa and to go up I have to go down.	0
When I attach a mouse it's fine but the touchpad is really annoying.	0
I went through the settings and there isn't a way to fix it.	0
It's a great laptop, but right now it's annoying to use the touchpad.	2
