Well, my first apple computer and I am impressed.	2
Works well, fast and no reboots.	2
Glad I did so far.	2
s.... L .... o..... w....  rea......llllyy  slow.	0
like seriously  - really slow.	0
impossible to use.	0
cant even read properly.	0
plus - no russian input ??  wtf	0
What a great laptop, I can run my games and work really fast.	2
Really light you can carry with you everywhere.	2
Great battery life.	2
Everything at a very great price.	2
I completely recommend it.	2
Excellent value and a must buy for someone looking for a Macbook.	2
You can't get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive.	2
Plus you get 500GB which is also a great feature.	2
Also, the resale value on this will keep.	2
I highly recommend you get one before they are gone.	2
Got this on black friday with a very good discount and couldn't be happier.	2
The screen is great, I don't see the need for a retina display.	2
I also really like the addition of the SD Card slot.	2
This Macbook Pro is AMAZING!	2
If you are afraid of it not having a disc player please don't be.	2
I love the new high retina display, and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter.	2
Overall, this is a fast, light, practical computer and I highly recommend it.	2
I bought my Macbook Pro in October of 2012 and 2 years later it still works as flawless as ever!	2
I've never had any problems with the computer itself (The Macbook charger chords are another story, though).	2
I tried not to jump on the Apple bandwagon, but... you're just living in denial if you don't.	2
Happy buying!	2
Bought this laptop from best buy in January 2015.. still loving it.	2
I can use it as a tablet,as a laptop, as whatever I want to!	2
I play Sims 4 and 3 on it all the time, with very little issues.	2
The thing wakes up super fast and is always ready to go.	2
Music/videos sound great and look great.	2
I use it everyday.	2
My favorite computer I've ever had!	2
This computer overall is great!	2
it runs fast!	2
ships fast!	2
etc. but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck!	0
I bought this pc to play games and stream movies! it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd!	2
I could see the disk drive on the side but it didn't seem to have a button on it?	0
A DISK DRIVE WITH BUTTONS ON IT!!!!!!	0
And he said&quot; this computer does not have a disk drive and I was furious!	0
So beware buyer, this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it.	0
Thank you asus.(they don't deserve to be capitalized)	0
Great computer.	2
Very great Apple product as expected.	2
Good battery life.	2
Great color on screen.	2
Good speakers from laptop computer.	2
My new laptop is great.	2
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp.	2
I have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but I like it.	1
I would recommend it to anyone.	2
This laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing.	2
The speakers are fairly basic, so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies.	1
The touchpad is a little &quot;clunky&quot; for my taste; I use a small external mouse with laptops  in any event.	0
I appreciate the relatively large keyboard (with number pad) and screen size.	2
I also found the track pad irritating until I disabled &quot;pinch zoom.&quot;	0
This is larger laptop, but is not too heavy.	2
Battery life is great - though it is new.	2
Overall, a solid laptop for its price.	2
However, a few things are immediately occurring to me  I had read the other reviews here on amazon, but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead.	2
Well, my first impressions are that its OK, it certainly boots up quickly (thanks SSD!), and from the limited use so far (no games) its fast enough in normal usage.	1
It certainly looks nice, but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out.	2
Also I have found the touch pad to be awkward to use (could be I am pressing too hard perhaps), and the screen is    well   underwhelming.	0
To be honest I am a little disappointed and considering returning it.	0
This is a horrible laptop.	0
Within a day of usage, it already slowed down significantly, virus entered the system right away.	0
It's heavy.	0
I regretted immediately.	0
Nothing like the description says.	0
My Apple mac book pro has crashed three times, since I purchased it.	0
Each time, Apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over.	0
I believe this MacBook Pro was a lemon right out the gate.	0
:(	0
This computer is like...  I'm lost for words.	2
This is the best switch I have ever done.	2
This has much more memory and ram memory.	2
Even the battery life is like WOW!	2
I love, LOVE, LOOOOVE!	2
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied.	2
It contains a long battery life, incredible specs, and an overall enjoyable performance.	2
Upgrading from a toshiba laptop, I am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides.	2
The snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos, as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy.	2
In upgrading to this computer I can say I have found little to any flaws in the product, hence the 5 star review.	2
Love this computer.	2
It has done everything and more that I expected.	2
I am sure it will be able to do all I need it to do in the future as well.	2
The screen looks great in my opinion the sound is nice.	2
So far I have no complaints and dont expect many complaints in the future.	2
This did give some set trouble and i had to call tech support.	0
They were great.	2
its been easy breezy since then.	2
how could you not love a Mac	2
so far so good, i have not encountered any issues with this computer.	2
love the flip feature and the touch screen feature.	2
for the price that i paid i feel that i got good value.	1
this lap top is not the lightest you can purchase, so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more.	0
To a prospective buyer,  08/10/2012  Once you go Mac, you'll never go back.	2
Was the best decision we ever made.	2
It runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems!	2
We don't have to de-frag, deliete cookies, run security programs, or any of the common PC problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed.	2
You can't get a virus on Mac, so in the long run the cost of the Mac is saved by not buying security, and not having to replace your computer every year or two.	2
Never had any issues, no frustrations just great easy wireless, all in one fun!	2
It's great.	2
because it is a touch screen you don't even need a mouse.	2
You will probably never use it in tablet mode but it's nice to know you have that option.	2
If you draw on the other hand i'm sure you will love using this in tablet mode.	2
Lastly, because it can flip 360 you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard.	2
This computer is great.	2
I have a 250 GB SSD and 10 GB of RAM in it, which I installed myself.	1
It runs faster than it did when I got it.	2
I enjoy the simplicity and user-friendly interface of Yosemite.	2
I'm excited for El Capitan.	2
The apps are very easy to use.	2
The resolution is excellent.	2
I am very satisfied with EVERYTHING about this machine.	2
Like so many others who do this there is a learning curve and I'm excited to do it.	2
This MBP is clean, neat, and simple.	2
I like that.	2
It takes less time to power up, and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode.	2
WHen you open it wakes up almost immediately.	2
Very nice.	2
I am pleased with my decision, however I have only had this for a few weeks.	2
There are a few things I am dissappointed with though.	0
Only 2 USB ports.	0
No HDMI port.	0
The headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone.	1
Not a big deal for me, but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac.	1
As a student majoring computer science, I really fell in love with this laptop.	2
It's 15.6 inches, which for me is not too big nor too small.	1
It has the latest i7 CPU with a GTX 950M for GPU, which makes this laptop blazing fast (boots up in under 5 seconds, with the help of the SSD of course).	2
- It has 256GB SSD which is just enough for my OS, games, documents, and anything in between.	2
It also has an extra bay for an extra HDD if you wish to add one.	2
- It's not touchscreen!	2
- Its keyboard is nicely arranged, silent, and back-lit which is nice, but what I don't like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers.	2
I have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good.	0
- This laptop is so silent, its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load, thanks to the 5th generation Intel core which draws less power,  thus less heat.	2
- It can run games really well.	2
Well, not really well.	1
MOBAs like Dota 2 and SMITE can be run on max quality settings with 60 fps or more.	1
Medium settings on titles like Tomb Raider for it to be acceptable (60 fps is the minimum acceptable fps #pcmasterrace).	1
- It's lightweight and easy to carry around.	2
- The screen is a matte 1080p display, which is nice, but with poor viewing angle.	2
I find myself adjusting it regularly.	0
- It looks sleek and gorgeous.	2
Blends in with any accessory you use with it.	2
All in all I am very happy with this purchase.	2
And with this price, I don't think you can buy anything better.	2
All I can say is I am impressed.	2
Very quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box.	2
It's worth it.	2
Pay me now, Pay me later.........I am happy with my choice going with this laptop.	2
I was disappointed.	0
It seemed like a great computer and a great deal.	0
The first one arrived and it did not work.	0
The space bar sticks.	0
I find it hard to navigate from screen to screen.	0
For a non-computer savvy person, it was very disappointing.	0
I like the 13 inch macbooks.	2
Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable.	2
The new Mac OS Mountain Lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad.	2
I didn't think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it I used it several times.	1
The magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool.	2
The mac is light and so compact I thought I would regret not buying a retina display, not in the least The mac pro works just fine.	2
The OS is easy, and offers all kinds of surprises.	2
I've been using Apple's since 1992 and this is the fastest and best one I've  had.	2
This Mac allows all of that.	2
This is very fast, high performance computer.	2
This should be more than  enough computer for almost everyone.	2
I would not hesitate recommending  this to anyone.	2
It fast and easy to set up.	2
I had cloned my data from my old computer using  Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) and simply moved everything to the new computer  and was off and running at speeds I had only dreamed up before.	2
The Mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized, lazy, and eye candy person in all of us.	2
The MacBook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide.	2
If you want to use the Internet, then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen, like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon.	2
This computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop.	2
I would've given 5 stars, had it not been for the hours of updates I've had to do to this upon arrival.	2
Other than that, I love it.	2
It's portable, reliable, and great for what I use it for.	2
Positives:  - No matter what position, this laptop will stay in it.	2
It's very sturdy.	2
- Quick boot-up, and runs efficiently.	2
- Touchscreen is great.	2
Negatives:  - As aforementioned, my only con was the updates.	0
Everything you'd expect from a Mac.	2
It looks and feels solid, with a flawless finish.	2
The screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down.	2
Only had it a few weeks but doesn't leave my side.	2
This machine is flawless, fast, and classy.	2
Out of all the laptops I have owned, this is by far the best!	2
I'm not sure if it was covered in the description, but it does have a backlit keyboard and I'm getting about an 8 hour battery life on one charge (Except I don't use this for games or videos, which obviously would drain the battery faster).	2
It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid.	2
The screen has an extremely high resolution that I'm very pleased with.	2
Even though MacBooks are expensive, you will see that they are well worth the money.	0
You will not regret buying this computer!	2
My daughter's MacBook Air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago.	0
It took 3 days to make an appointment at the local Apple store.	0
I'm not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $129 for a new battery, $39 to replace it and $139 for a new keyboard.	0
I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager.	0
He explained to me the battery expansion is 'normal'.	0
Apple doesn't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care.	0
The battery is simply considered 'consumable' and NOT covered.	0
I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn't consider the product defective.	0
His reply astonished me, looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said: 'Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear!	0
He didn't specify who are 'they' but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5' posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS.	0
Here is my take on all of this, the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China, hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school, call them geniuses, and bully everybody who complains about their product.	0
Steve Jobs is dead, so is Apple.	0
No more Apple devices in my household.	0
Please Google 'MacBook battery bulge explode' before you buy your next Apple toy.	0
I've been spoiled by the build quality and stability of Macintosh and even this used computer is a gem.	2
I can bat around all the things that everyone else says, but it's been what we've been using for decades and I have nothing bad to say.	2
It churns out HD content, runs without many flaws and I've yet to get a virus on a Mac since I started using the platform in the early 1990's.	2
My 15&amp;#34; MacBook's motherboard fried but I think that was a sugar spill that I never bothered cleaning up.	1
That's the only issue I've ever had since working on Macs in 1995.	2
That's a pretty impressive track record don't you think?	2
However, the HP Envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more.	2
I have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all.	2
While the price may seem high, it is worth every penny with its many perks.	0
The Pros:  A Ton of Storage Space- This laptop comes with 8GB of memory and a 1 TB (1000GB) hard drive.	2
That is plenty of space for your laptop, which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers.	2
2-in-1 Capability- The ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus.	2
If you are looking to get a 2-in-1 laptop, this is the laptop you should consider.	2
I love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies, without having the keyboard in the way of things.	2
I find it much easier to type on and much more durable.	2
Battery Life- My battery life is really good with this laptop and I have had no problems with it thus far.	2
I can usually go about 10 hours before I get down to 10% battery life.	2
The Cons:  No Disc Drive- Call me old fashioned, but I still enjoy listening to physical CDs and uploading them to iTunes.	0
However, I can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive.	0
Overall, I definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop.	2
The touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes.	2
It also is nice to be able to play Candy Crush or Angry Birds when in between classes straight from your laptop.	2
It makes it much more exciting to play!	2
I'm actually writing this review on my new MacBook and I love it!	2
The computer it self is amazing.	2
It is an older model, so know that upfront, but it is everything I was looking for.	1
From the moment I received this MacBook it was like a dream come true.	2
I know once I upgrade the ram to 8GB it will pick up a lot.	1
Also, if after reading some reviews and doing some research I found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus.	2
So long story short, if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop.	2
I know people were complaining that it isn't the newest model, but it all depends on what you are looking for.	1
I highly recommend!!	2
This computer is a fantastic tool for word processing, searching the internet, and keeping track of everyday life.	2
It's also incredibly light, has a battery that can last for days, and looks like a piece of art.	2
Though, that's pretty much what your paying for -- a well designed device.	1
When you look at the internal specs, the computer is only worth about $500.	0
It has a 128 GB storage capacity (but with the option of a 256 GB hard drive) and a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, so don't expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too.	0
If your looking to be a trendy hipster who can't live without a Mac, it's a great buy.	0
It mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don't need.	2
Pros :  1. Nice Looks.	2
2. Keyboard is great	2
I wanted a simple Full HD display and this one does its job	2
4. Sound is great	2
5. And this has a extra slot for HDD	2
6. No CD drive.	2
Cons:  1. Web cam.	0
VGA really ASUS??	0
You don't want to show this to anyone :).	0
Anyway I don't use webcam much so , I don't care	1
2. Viewing angles are not great.	0
3. Remember its a dual core.	0
4. The fan kicks in even its not too hot.	0
5. I found the track pad not great.	0
I use my mouse so not a problem for me.	1
Over all very good system and worth it.	2
This was the ONLY tablet-style computer so far which met my requirements.	2
I was seduced by this computer, so I took it home.	2
The wireless keyboard (not bluetooth, but RF) did not pair up with the device.	0
It still did not pair.	0
I even ran it as Administrator -- still no effect.	0
I used the Ctrl-Esc keys while turning on, and still nothing.	0
It flickers briefly to green before the light goes out.	0
I still can't pair it.	0
I don't want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional.	0
Sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while I get my money back for a DEFECTIVE product.	0
But Sony doesn't seem to have addressed it.	0
My first Mac computer and as many before me I just fall in love with it.	2
Changed the memory from 4 GB to 8 GB Corsair Vengeance and 500 GB HDD (5400 rpm) with Seagate hybride 750 GB HDD+SSD.	1
Machine is flying and with parallels desktop 8 I have my old PC notebook completely functional on my MBP.	2
Way to go and enjoy both worlds.	2
This ASUS you're looking at right here, and that I'm typing on right now, has one.	2
-  With that being said, for the price ($800!), you get a nice fast laptop, but if you ask me, it's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included:	2
This laptop has no:  - Touchscreen  - Optical Drives (OK, a bit of a stretch, because that would eat up precious space in this monster)  - Swivel or detachable screen	0
What this laptop does have is:  - Windows 8, which is confusing as all get-out  - Tons of &amp;#34;bloatware&amp;#34;.	0
This is really nice, but I HATE the awkward right mouse clicking.. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.. may be the laptop, may be the laptop in conjunction with Windows 8? 	2
Either way, highly annoying.	0
I hooked up a USB mouse and all is well.	2
All works beautifully but Windows 8 is taking a bit of getting used to.	2
Love the 360 degree rotation and the touch screen works great, but a little bit of a learning curve there too, as sometimes I have to tap a few times to get the exact location I need...	2
overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop (the mouse was the only negative I could really see)...	2
This is a fantastic transformer!	2
I loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows 8 platform.	2
The only reason I returned it was because I bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program, it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate.	0
I would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase.	2
It's a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen.	2
I'm looking forward to needing a laptop update so I can purchase this computer again.	2
I've only had this for a week Overall I like the computer, it's thin &amp; light and The wireless keyboard works great.	2
I was impressed; Sony puts in small touches like a USB charging port on the charger.	2
