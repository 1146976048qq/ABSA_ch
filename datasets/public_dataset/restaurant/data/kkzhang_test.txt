Yum!	2
Serves really good sushi.	2
Not the biggest portions but adequate.	1
Green Tea creme brulee is a must!	2
Don't leave the restaurant without it.	2
No Comparison	2
– I can't say enough about this place.	2
It has great sushi and even better service.	2
The entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need.	2
I've been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date.	2
Snotty Attitude	0
– We were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast.	0
The owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint.	0
Good food!	2
This is a great place to get a delicious meal.	2
We never had to wait more than 5 minutes.	2
The staff is pretty friendly.	2
The onion rings are great!	2
They are not greasy or anything.	2
Overrated	0
– I was highly disappointed in the food at Pagoda.	0
The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns, the few they actually give you.....were not good.	0
Nice ambience, but highly overrated place.	2
I will not go back.	0
Worst Service I Ever Had	2
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received.	0
Our waiter was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered, we were not given any water or utensils.	0
I complained to the manager, but he was not even apologetic.	0
I will never return again.	0
Fabulous Italian Food!	2
– I highly recommend Mioposto.	2
I am so happy to have a wonderful Italian restaurant in my neighborhood.	2
The wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy.	2
I love this restaurant	2
– I will never forget the amazing meal, service, and ambiance I experience at this restaurant.	2
It was absolutely amazing.	2
The wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse, the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice, good at their jobs and cultured.	2
I have not a bad thing to say about this place.	2
AMAZING.	2
I cannot wait to go back again this coming weekend!	2
Mmm... good!	2
The food was great!	2
It's *very* reasonably priced, esp for the quality of the food.	2
I had the Kafta plate and it was perfect.	2
We're going back. :D	2
Finally a meal that you will remember for a long time!	2
– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants, its nice to see a place that bucks that trend, and just plain delivers high quality food and good service, period.	2
This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer.	2
Caution - its real food for people who love the best.	2
Very Disappointing	0
– I took my parents here for their anniversary-very very disappointed!!!	0
I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price.	2
I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.	0
Rice is too dry, tuna wasn't so fresh either.	0
Nothing really came across as outstanding.	0
Very disappointed.	0
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent.	2
However, the value and service are both severely lacking.	0
Furthermore, while the fish is unquestionably fresh, rolls tend to be inexplicably bland.	2
The service ranges from mediocre to offensive.	0
On a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.	0
We were then charged for their most expensive sake ($20+ per serving) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price.	0
Freshest sushi  – I love this restaurant.	2
They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls.	2
The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted.	2
Their apps are all delicious.	2
The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side.	0
But the space is small and lovely, and the service is helpful.	2
You are bound to have a very charming time.	2
Not recommanded!!!	0
– The food was not great & the waiters were rude.	0
It is not worth going at all and spend your money there!!!	0
great service	2
– Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican AND downtown.	2
my service was stellar!	2
the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me.	2
food was fine, with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa.	2
If you're in the area you shouldn't be disappointed.	2
Ok.... – Maybe I went in on someone's bad day....	0
the food was great, the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.	2
Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.	0
I don't know if I'll be back....	0
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place.	2
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it's edible, even when you order ahead.	0
BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.	2
Best Sushi in town.	2
Everything you want and more, very fresh.	2
Its worth the wait, especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready.	2
The best calamari in Seattle!	2
– ...and the best summertime deck experience--they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather.	2
A perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year.	2
Endless fun, awesome music, great staff!!!	2
– By far the best bar in the east village...	2
I went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast!	2
"Every time ""0-sixtynine"" is called the bartender buys everyone drinks!"	2
Been there lots since and its always a good time.	2
Great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks.	2
Definitely has one of the best jukebox's i've seen in a long long time.	2
I FOUND A NEW HOME ON SECOND AVENUE!!!!!!!!!!!!	2
Just go there and see for yourself.	2
The food is great, the bartenders go that extra mile.	2
You need to watch your game, they will have it on for you.	2
The owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for.	2
And the upstairs is a great place to hang out.	2
Not alot of smoking places left in New York, but I have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city.	2
Kudos to these guys.	2
I found a new home and just moved with a long lease.	2
The sushi here is delicious!	2
They have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from; Atlantic or Pacific.	2
I've had the Jellyfish, Horse Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.	2
My only negative comment is that I wish the pieces were a little bigger.	0
The decor is rustic, traditional Japanese.	1
The crowd is mixed yuppies, young and old.	1
The service was courteous and attentive.	2
Mediocre food	1
The outside patio area has an abbreviated menu.	1
My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price.	0
We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.	0
Service was decent.	1
Drinks were good.	2
Unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks I wouldn't recommend going here.	2
You are likely to be disappointed.	0
Excellent food, nice ambience, fairly expensive	2
– I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi (5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes.	2
The ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney.	2
It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa.	2
I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge! (it was a bit expensive)	2
Best Indian food in L.A.	2
The best thing is, the prices are also quite reasonable.	2
The chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes.	2
The chana masala (garbanzo beans) are also excellent.	2
It's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center, not the greatest location, but the food keeps me coming back for more.	1
hidden little jem	2
– tucked away over by the Beverly Center.	1
Never too crowded and always great service.	2
I think I have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent.	2
I can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma.	2
You routinely see Indian families and friends dining there, which is always a good sign.	2
I appreciate their delivery too.	2
Nice food but no spice!	2
– I really enjoyed my meal here.	2
I had yummy lamb korma, saag paneer, samosas, naan, etc.	2
The food was all good but it was way too mild.	2
Normally, places ask how hot you want it, but they didn't.	0
I should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild.	0
The naan was some of the best I've had and I really enjoyed the bhartha, not too tomatoey.	2
Even the chickpeas, which I normally find too dry, were good.	2
And they packaged everything nicely so it didn't spill.	2
awesome find	2
– I don't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long... the fajita salad, the colorado, the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious.	2
I love the warm & cosy environment.	2
I just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party - can't wait to celebrate my next birthday there.	2
best restaurant in the world, great decor, great customer service, friendly manager	2
i am never disappointed with there food.	2
the atmosphere is great.	2
great lunch spot	2
– Great financial district mexican spot.	2
Always busy, but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service.	2
Everything I've had here is good, taco salads, burritos, enchiladas i love this place.	2
Also have great margaritas!	2
You can order to go if you have to get back to the office too!	2
Lebanese Food!Yum!	2
– I've been to Open Sesame only once, but I'm still reeling from the experience!!	2
The food is simply unforgettable!	2
The presentation of the food was an added bonus, it looked just as great as it tasted!	2
My best friend had the chicken shawarma and she STILL raves about it being the best anywhere!	2
What a tastly, flaky treat!	2
The staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful.	2
GO TO OPEN SESAME!!!	2
Holy Hummus!	2
– The food is here is incredible, though the quality is inconsistent during lunch.	2
Dinners have always been excellent, in terms of food quality.	2
The open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given.	2
The side of potatoes is to die for, as is the labne (yogurt dip).	2
Also, they serve THE best hummus in America, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil (which, I believe is the traditional way)!	2
The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service.	0
There have been several occasions when we've just not gotten some side dishes we've ordered.	0
However, this place is a gem, and I won't stop going back.	2
great beer	2
– My first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible!	0
We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food.	0
I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal.	0
HOWEVER, one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go (although with my loud protests) and were pleasantly surprised.	2
The band was very good and the service was attentive.	2
We ordered a selection of the small plates, and the shoe string onions, goat cheese pizza, grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good.	2
It was like dining at a completely different restaurant.	2
We have since returned and also had a great experience, sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good).	2
We did have the same waiter the second time, so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good.	2
Sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun.	2
Seattle's BEST Winelist	2
– Ray's (suprisingly) has the city's BEST & most diverse wine list.	2
The sommelier is fantastic, down-to-earth, & extremely knowlegable.	2
I would go back for the wine experience alone.	2
Nice job!	2
NOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS	0
"– It is sad to see a place that was once ""THE"" place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch, now be the place that is a big ""DONT BOTHER."""	0
The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).	0
What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment.	0
"This establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS ""DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES"" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of."	0
"Perhaps now, Scooner or Later falls into the ""Dive"" category."	0
This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.	0
I hope one day Scooner or Later returns to what it once was.	0
Untill this happens, my advice is to STAY AWAY.	0
Open & Cool Place with the Best Pizza and Coffee	2
– Mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu.	2
The coffe is very good, too.	2
Great open and friendly ambience.	2
This place is charming and relaxing.	2
The servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful.	2
It's a great place to enjoy food and meet friends.	2
Old Reliable	2
– After 12 years in Seattle Ray's rates as the place we always go back to.	2
Great food, spectacular location, and friendly service keep us coming back year after year.	2
Enjoyed the food	2
I liked it.	2
Food was good and cheap.	2
I had the kafta plate and I enjoyed it.	2
It was so much though that I could barely finish but I did, since it was delicious.	1
Atmosphere was nice.	2
Service was kind of slow, our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it wasn't that busy.	0
Still I would recommend this place.	2
WOW!!!!!!!!	2
– IT CANT GET ANY BETTER!!!!!	2
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING FOOD WOW	2
Great food with an awesome atmosphere!	2
– Eggs, pancakes, potatoes, fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious.	2
The best place for a leisure Sunday breakfast amidst yachts, then take a stroll through the nearby Farmer's Market.	2
great meal – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect!!!!	2
plus, i am allergic to rice, and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating -- didn't even bat an eye!	2
and the waiter suggested a perfect sake!!	2
absolutely fabulous!!!	2
Unbeatable sushi!	2
Two thumbs up!	2
This is right up there with places in Tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned.	2
Melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi, and very tasty rolls too.	2
Be sure to try the oyster roll.	2
splendid	2
– How to describe the best sushi in NYC: hmmmm, delicious, amazing, fantastic, suculent, perfect, nah, all of the above.	2
I can't saybenough good things about this restaurant, and I can't wait for my next several visits.	2
The best Chuwam Mushi I have ever had.	2
Perfect on a cold day.	2
$6 with tip.	2
Perfection.	2
Good Sushi, High Price 	2
One of the best Sushi place in town.	2
The house special roll is really good.	2
On weekends, you might have to wait for couple hours.	1
However, they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone.	2
A cozy spot for 2	2
– I can't believe Murphy's has been around for over 25 years, amazing.	2
That's a huge compliment, especially in the fickled restaurant business, ...enough already!	2
Brunch at Murphy's is to die for, my specialty... egg white omelet, the food is always freshly prepared.	2
It's the perfect spot for a romantic date for 2 or a secret rendezvous!	2
Save room for  scrumptious desserts.	2
The restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you won't forget!	2
I guarantee you won't be disappointed, there's also valet parking.	2
Addicting!	2
– Best Mexican place for lunch in the financial district.	2
Love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their specials.	2
The cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes.	2
Can get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated, the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly.	2
I went there with a friend from out of town... and we were both very impressed!	2
The sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick.	2
The price was right too.	2
The atmosphere was just okay.	1
Space was limited, but the food made up for it.	0
I'd go back there in a heartbeat.	2
Well I guess it's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff.	0
We stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us.	0
"Finally, my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked, ""Are you waiting for a table?"""	0
Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal.	0
The prior reviews said Kid friendly... give me a break with two young children that is light years.	0
The Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I couldn't eat it.	0
It was decent but nothing exceptional.	1
Great food, better Margaritas!	2
– This is one of my top lunch spots, huge portions, fast service and amazing margaritas!!	2
it gets really busy, so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat, if you do have to wait, its not bad because the service is quick!	2
Check out the art on the walls, very colorful!	2
i love this place!	2
– i have been eating at this place for over 8 years now and i have never had one bad meal.	2
i highly recommend this place to all that want to try indain food for the first time.	2
The lunch menu is an awesome deal!	2
plenty of food,trust me .	2
Fresh ingrediants and super tasty.	2
The place is the next best thing to my Moms cooking.	2
Best food, phenominal service 	2
For the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best NYC has to offer, the fish is the freshest and the service is superb.	2
Not only can the selection be innovative, but there's a nice balance of traditional sushi as well.	2
The nicest waiters in town.	2
WAY OVER-RATED!!!!	0
– This place is unbelievably over-rated.	0
If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food, then I would put Murphy's at the top of the list.	1
The regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive.	1
10!	2
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro.	2
There is only one place on the east coast that has it all, plus a lot more.	2
Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world: BLUE RIBBON SUSHI.	2
Cut to the chase - this is amazing!	2
It's unpretentious and underground.	2
It's fresh, welcoming, delicious, and relaxing.	2
